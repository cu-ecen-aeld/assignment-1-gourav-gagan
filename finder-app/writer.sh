#   the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; 
#   the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr
# Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
# Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, 
#   overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. 
# Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.

# Example:
#       writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios

# Creates file:
#    /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt
# With content:
#            ios
